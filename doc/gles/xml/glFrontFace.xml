    <title>Description</title>

    <para>In a scene composed entirely of opaque closed surfaces,
    back-facing polygons are never visible. Eliminating (culling) these
    invisible polygons has the obvious benefit of speeding up the
    rendering of the image. To enable and disable culling, call 
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>glEnable</refentrytitle></citerefentry> and 
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>glDisable</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
    with argument <constant>GL_CULL_FACE</constant>.
    Culling is initially disabled.
    </para>

    <para>The projection of a polygon to window coordinates is said
    to have clockwise winding if an imaginary object following the
    path from its first vertex, its second vertex, and so on, to
    its last vertex, and finally back to its first vertex, moves in
    a clockwise direction about the interior of the polygon. The
    polygon's winding is said to be counterclockwise if the
    imaginary object following the same path moves in a
    counterclockwise direction about the interior of the polygon. 
    <function>glFrontFace</function>
    specifies whether polygons with clockwise winding in window
    coordinates, or counterclockwise winding in window coordinates,
    are taken to be front-facing. Passing 
    <constant>GL_CCW</constant> to <parameter>mode</parameter>
    selects counterclockwise polygons as front-facing. 
    <constant>GL_CW</constant>
    selects clockwise polygons as front-facing. By default,
    counterclockwise polygons are taken to be front-facing.</para>
