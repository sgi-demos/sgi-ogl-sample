    <title>Description</title>

    <para>Different GL implementations buffer commands in several
    different locations, including network buffers and the graphics
    accelerator itself.  <function>glFlush</function>
    empties all of these buffers, causing all issued commands to be
    executed as quickly as they are accepted by the actual
    rendering engine. Though this execution may not be completed in
    any particular time period, it does complete in finite
    time.</para>

    <para>Because any GL program might be executed over a network,
    or on an accelerator that buffers commands, all programs should
    call <function>glFlush</function>
    whenever they count on having all of their previously issued
    commands completed. For example, call <function>glFlush</function>
    before waiting for user input that depends on the generated
    image.</para>

    <title>Notes</title>

    <para>
      <function>glFlush</function>
      can return at any time. It does not wait until the execution of
      all previously issued GL commands is complete.
